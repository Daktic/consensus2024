## Description

The Hoops project is a DeFi protocol focused on assessing and bundling the risk of different liquidity pools. It leverages smart contracts to automate and manage liquidity provisioning, enabling users to earn fees from trades. By analyzing various risk metrics, Hoops optimizes liquidity pools for balanced returns and minimal slippage, while also incorporating community governance for protocol improvements.
